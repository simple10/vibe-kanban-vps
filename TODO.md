# TODO

- [x] Add docker resource output to deploy-log.md to show user the vibe-kanban container details after deploy
- [x] Switch from docker volumes to bind mounts to make backups easier on the VPS
- [x] Add a codex-login.sh script - similar to claude-login.sh
- [x] Add a ssh-vibekanban.sh script to ssh into the vibe-kanban container
- [x] Update README.md and CLAUDE.md with references to the new scripts (as needed)
